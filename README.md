## Social Engineering ##
The Social Engineering module will consist of 4 sub-modules. These being:
* Database Skimming - Skim through hundreds of files and documents for a desired search query.
* Spear-Phishing Attacks - Used for testing threat analysis tools for web platforms and email phishing techniques.
* Malware Attacks - By creating and deploying custom malware to a target via email etc.
* Bruteforce Attacks - A useful module for cracking into different accounts.

## Hardware Hacking ##
The Hardware Hacking module will consist of 3 sub-modules. These being:
* Mi Fare 1k/4k - A basic modules that will attempt to crack and clone an ID card, which can be used to gain access to something IRL. 
* Metasploit - An external module which has a massive database on searchable terms based on the hardware in question.
* Kayak - Another external hacking tool, which is used to hack and test security on smart cars.

## Malware Analysis ##
The Malware Analysis module will consist of 4 sub-modules. These being:
* Google Dorking - Find websites hosted on the Clearnet which have publicly accessible source code.
* Honeypots - A small module used to catch malware varients attempting to hijack IoT devices.
* Reverse Engineering - A tool used for finding & changing pieces of code to get an expected outcome.
* Packet Analysis - Finding and checking for different connection methods for pieces of software, which could be seen as an attempt to infect a device.
